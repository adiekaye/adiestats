## adiestats

A work-in-progress library of stats functions I've been writing as practice.

It currently includes functions for:

*basic data processes
*averages
  *mean, median, mode
  *weighted mean
  *approximate mean for grouped data
  *geometric mean (growth rate)
*variability (for both sample and population data)
  *range, IQR
  *variance and standard deviation
  *variance and standard deviation for grouped data
  *skewness
*finding simple relationships between variables
  *covariance
  *correlation
  *quick-read on direction/strength of relationship 
  *least squares regression
*simple probability space operations
  *union
  *intersection
  *mutual exclusivity test
  *collective exhaustion test
